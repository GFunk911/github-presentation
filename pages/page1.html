    <h1>Distributed vs. Centralized</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system (<span class="caps">VCS</span>).</p>
    <p>A <span class="caps">VCS</span> can be centralized or distributed</p>
    <p><strong>Centralized</strong><br />
    There is only one repository.  Users check out a working copy from the repository to their machine.  <br />
    Commits flow between the central repository and the user.<br />
    Examples: Subversion, <span class="caps">CVS</span></p>
    <p><strong>Distributed</strong><br />
    There are many versions of the repository.  Users &#8220;clone&#8221; an existing repository onto their machine.  <br />
    Commits can potentially flow between any user/repository.  <br />
    The central repository is designated by convention.<br />
    Examples: Git, Mercurial, Darcs, Bazaar</p>
